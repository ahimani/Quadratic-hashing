# Quadratic-hashing

This project aims to implement open addressing hashing using quadratic hashing. The hash table is implemented using a vector which increases its size and re-hashes the entire table when the load factor becomes greater than 0.5

It also provides min and max functions that return the smallest and the largest keys in the hashmap at any time.
